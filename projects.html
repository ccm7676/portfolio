        <h1>MORSY</h1>
        <p>Morsy is an open-source private messenger. Many private messengers nowadays have one major fault, which is the centralized nature of the servers which the messages are sent through.  Morsy's primary aim is to provide privacy to its users while requiring zero trust in the servers. This is achieved by using WebRTC to send the messages directly between users, making the server's sole purpose to provide the initial connection. </p>
